=== Crash

. The offline mode trial does not add days.
. Not close the software will not trigger verification
. Trial pop-up window is related to `LastDemoAlert` in `~/Library/Preferences/com.latenightsw.ScriptDebugger8.plist`.
 .. Cannot be greater than the current time.
 .. Click on the trial to update the field.
. StartTime is `2022-07-18 11:36:30(2022-07-18T03:37:37Z)`
. Logic
 .. Trial Day   = SystemTime   -    StartTime
 .. Alert Trial = SystemTime   -   `LastDemoAlert` > 1
